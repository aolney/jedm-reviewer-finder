    "students’ learning [Anderson, Bellezza & Boyle, 1993; Heathcote, Brown, & Mewhort,\n",
    "2002]. The slope of learning curves show the rate at which a student learns over time, and\n",
    "reveals how well the tutor’s cognitive model fits what the student is learning. However,\n",
    "these learning curves require a method for attributing error to the “knowledge\n",
    "components” (skills or concepts) in the student model that the student is missing.\n",
    "Knowledge components, concepts and skills will be used interchangeably in this paper. In\n",

    "Authors’ addresses: A.F. Nwaigwe, School of Information Technology and Communication, American\n",
    "University of Nigeria, Nigeria; E-mail : adaeze.nwaigwe@aun.edu.ng; K.R. Koedinger, Human Computer\n",
    "Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.; E-mail : koedinger@cmu.edualternative heuristics were evaluated - simple location heuristic (LH), simple temporal\n",
    "heuristic (TH), model-based location heuristic (MLH) and model-based temporal\n",
    "heuristic (MTH) [Nwaigwe et al., 2007]. When evaluated on the learning curve standard,\n",
    "the two location heuristics LH and MLH, outperformed the temporal heuristics, TH and\n",
    "MTH. However, the generality of performance of these heuristics in other ITS subject\n",
    "domains needs to be tested.\n",
    "In this study conducted in the mathematics domain, we investigated whether the\n",
    "previous performance of the LH and TH generalized to other ITS domains. We\n",
    "specifically asked if the LH was better than the TH at predicting student changes in error\n",
    "rate over time. We used log data from a Cognitive Tutor on a Scatterplot lesson and\n",
    "implemented the learning curves standard using the statistical component of Learning\n",
    "Factors Analysis [Cen, Koedinger & Junker, 2005; Pirolli & Wilson, 1998].\n",
    "Our intuition is that the LH may be the better choice for error attribution when\n",
    "knowledge components (KCs) can be determined by the interface location where an\n",
    "action occurs. To justify this, imagine that a worker has homes, H a and H b in which to\n",
    "perform tasks A and B respectively. The worker goes to home H a and attempts task A but\n",
    "fails. The worker abandons the failed task A and goes to home H b , where he/she succeeds\n",
    "at task B. The assumption is that tasks A and B are associated with different KCs. The\n",
    "worker later returns to location H a , and this time, is successful at task A. The LH will\n",
    "more rationally attribute the initial failed attempt at H a to the KC associated with task A\n",
    "since its rule is to attribute error to the first successfully implemented KC at the initial\n",
    "error location. The TH will however, wrongfully put blame on the KC associated with\n",
    "task B since its method of error attribution is to blame the KC associated with the first\n",
    "correctly implemented task.\n",
    "Sometimes, TH might be a better choice for making error attribution. We believe this\n",
    "to be the case when it is necessary to perform a set of tasks in a prescribed sequence. To\n",
    "elaborate, imagine that homeschooler Bella is required to perform two tasks and in the\n",
    "given sequence – eat breakfast (EB), and do schoolwork (DS) and in any of two\n",
    "locations, L1 and L2 on the dining table of the family’s apartment. We again assume that\n",
    "tasks EB and DS are associated with different KCs. Bella decides that she did not like\n",
    "what Mom served for breakfast that morning and goes straight to her schoolwork, DS, at\n",

    "2. ERROR ATTRIBUTION HEURISTICS\n",
    "A basic assumption of many cognitive models is that knowledge can be decomposed into\n",
    "components, that each component is learned independently of the others and that\n",
    "implementation of a step in the solution of a problem is an attempt to apply one or more\n",
    "knowledge components (KCs). When correct solution steps are generated, either by an\n",
    "expert system or a human expert, the step is often annotated with the KCs that must be\n",
    "applied in order to generate the step. Thus, when a student enters that step, the system\n",
    "can infer that the student is probably (but not necessarily) applying those KCs.An ITS system can be designed to anticipate and generate some incorrect steps and\n",
    "associated goals, however, it is rare for expert systems or expert authors to anticipate and\n",
    "generate a large number of incorrect steps and corresponding goals. Hence, when the\n",
    "student enters an incorrect step, it is often not clear what KC(s) should have been applied,\n",
    "so the system cannot determine which KC(s) the student is weak on. If the system simply\n",
    "ignores incorrect steps, then it only “sees” successful applications of KCs. It cannot\n",
    "“see” failures of a KC. It may see lots of incorrect steps, but it cannot determine and\n",
    "record what KC(s) to blame for each error [VanLehn et al, 2005] and so, learning curves\n",
    "cannot be generated. This suggests using heuristics.\n",
    "The tutoring system usually has two clues available: the location of the incorrect step\n",
    "on the user interface and the subsequent steps entered by the student. For instance, if a\n",
    "student makes an error on a step at time 1 and at location A, the student will often attempt\n",
    "to correct it immediately, perhaps with help from the tutor. So if the first correct step, at\n",
    "time 2 is also at location A, and say, that the step is annotated with KC x, then it is likely\n",
    "that the incorrect step at time 1 was a failed attempt to apply KC x. This heuristic allows\n",
    "the system to attribute errors to KCs whenever the system sees a correct step immediately\n",
    "following the target incorrect step, and both steps are in the same location on the user\n",
    "interface.\n",
    "However, it is not clear how to generalize this heuristic. What if the next correct step\n",
    "is not in the same location? What if there are intervening incorrect steps in different\n",
    "locations? In previous work using data from the Andes Physics Tutor, four automated\n",
    "heuristics for making error attribution (LH, TH, MLH, MTH) were proposed and\n",
    "evaluated guided by whether the heuristic was driven by location or by the temporal order\n",
    "of events [Nwaigwe et al, 2007].\n",
    "For every error transaction, LH attributes blame to the KC mapped to a subsequent\n",
    "correct entry at the widget location where the error occurred [Anderson, Bellezza &\n",
    "Boyle,1993; Koedinger & Mathan, 2004; Martin, Mitrovic, Mathan, & Koedinger, 2005]\n",
    "while the TH ascribes blame to the KC that labels the first correct entry in time. When\n",
    "there is no subsequent correct entry with a label of the error location, LH blames the KC\n",
    "with the first correct entry in time, that is, it implements the behavior of TH. When the\n",
    "tutor provides a choice of some KC to blame for an error, the MLH goes with the tutor’s\n",
    "choice otherwise, it simply implements the LH. For an error transaction, MTH also goes\n",
    "with the domain model’s choice if one exists, otherwise it implements the TH.\n",
    "In this work, we examine the performance of the LH and TH in the mathematics\n",

    "ambiguity. Columns in table 1 are described thus: “location” column indicates the place\n",
    "on the interface (the interface widget) in which the student made an input; “Outcome”\n",
    "indicates if an input is correct or not, while “Student Model KC” lists the system’s choice\n",
    "of KC which the student should implement.\n",
    "In row 1, the student makes an error at the location labeled, “var-0val-1”. The system\n",
    "however does not indicate the KC the student ought to be practicing. To resolve this\n",
    "ambiguity, the LH uses the KC that labels a subsequent correct entry in the same location\n",
    "– see row 5. That is, it chooses “choose variable”. On the other hand, the TH chooses the\n",
    "KC that labels the first correct entry in time, irrespective of interface location. Its choice\n",
    "is “label x-axis”. In row #2, the domain model blames the KC “choose variable” for the\n",
    "student’s error. LH chooses “choose variable” since it is the first correctly implemented\n",
    "KC at the location “var-0val-1”. TH blames the KC “label x-axis” in this case.\n",

    "Koedinger, 2005; Mitrovic & Ohlsson, 1990]. For ITSs, the standard approach is to\n",
    "measure the proportion of knowledge components in the domain model that have been\n",
    "“incorrectly” applied by the student. This is also known as the “error rate”. Other\n",
    "alternatives exist, such as the number of attempts taken to correct a particular type of\n",
    "error. Time is generally represented as the number of opportunities to practice a KC or\n",
    "skill. This in turn may be determined in different ways: for instance, it may represent\n",
    "each new step a student attempts that is relevant to the skill, on the basis that repeated\n",
    "attempts at the KC are benefiting from the student having been given feedback and as-\n",
    "needed instruction about that particular skill and hence may improve from one attempt to\n",
    "the next. If the student is learning the KC or skill being measured, the learning curve will\n",
    "follow a so-called “power law of practice” [Mathan & Koedinger, 2005]. If such a curve\n",
    "exists, it presents evidence that the student is learning the skill being measured or\n",

    "4. DATA SOURCE\n",
    "The data used for this research was collected as part of a study conducted in a set of 5\n",
    "middle-school classrooms at 2 schools in the suburbs of a medium-sized city in the\n",
    "Northeastern United States. Student ages ranged approximately from 12 to 14 years. The\n",
    "classrooms studied were taking part in the development of a new 3-year cognitive tutor\n",
    "curriculum for middle school mathematics [Baker, 2005; Baker., Corbett, Koedinger &\n",
    "Wagner, 2004]. Data collected was from the study on these classrooms during the course\n",
    "of a short (2 class periods) cognitive tutor unit on scatterplot generation and\n",
    "interpretation. Scatterplots depict the relationship between two quantitative variables in a\n",
    "Cartesian plane, using a point to represent paired values of each variable.\n",
    "The scatterplot lesson consisted of a set of problems and for each problem, a student\n",
    "was given a data set to generate a graph. The student then had to choose from a list, the\n",
    "variables that were appropriate for use in the scatterplot (see figure 1); those that where\n",
    "quantitative or categorical; and subsequently whether a chosen variable was appropriate\n",
    "for a bar chart.\n",
    "Next the student was required to label the X and Y-axis (see figure 2), and to choose\n",
    "each axis bound and scale. The student was then required to plot points on the graph by\n",
    "clicking on the desired position on the graph. Finally, the student was required to answer\n",
    "a set of interpretation questions to reason about the graph’s trend, outliers, monotonicity,\n",
    "and extrapolation and in comparison with other graphs. In our dataset, students solved a\n",
    "maximum of six problems and a minimum of two in the scatterplot lesson.Figure 1 Scatterplot lesson interface for choosing variable type [Baker, 2005]\n",
    "Figure 2 Interface for graph creation in the scatterplot lesson [Baker, 2005]5. METHODOLOGY\n",
    "The algorithms for the LH and TH used in this research was implemented in pure java 1.6\n",
    "and designed to process student log data in MS Excel format. Both algorithms used\n",
    "sequential search. Log data from the cognitive tutor unit on scatterplot generation and\n",
    "interpretation served as input to the programs. The output from each program was the\n",
    "choice of KC codes made by the heuristic being implanted as explained in section 2.\n",
    "To analyze the cognitive model of each heuristic according to the learning curve\n",
    "standard, the data output from each program was then fit to equation 1 to derive learning\n",
    "behavior. The coefficients of equation 1, initial KC difficulty ( \" j ), initial student difficulty\n",
    "( ! i ) and KC learning rate (# j ) were used to describe learning behavior for each heuristic. If\n",
    "the intercept of a KC was higher, then, its initial difficulty was lower. Further, if the slope\n",
    "of each KC was higher, then, the faster students learned that skill. For the model of each\n",
    "heuristic, BIC score was used to estimate prediction risk while loglikelihood was used to\n",
    "measure model fit.\n",
    "6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n",
    "Table II summarizes the results of the learning curve standard for the student models for\n",
    "both the LH and TH. The results show that the simple location heuristic, LH (BIC score:\n",
    "7,510.12) shows better fit to the learning curve standard compared to the simple temporal\n",
    "heuristic, TH (BIC scores: 7,703.58). This means that the model of the LH is more\n",
    "reliable and so, a prediction error is more likely to occur if one used the TH model.\n",
    "Loglikelihood score was also better for the LH (-3,370.37) than for the TH (-3,464.93),\n",

    "Generally, we observed that, the LH performed better than the TH when the student\n",
    "failed to successfully complete an attempted step and subsequently attempted and\n",
    "succeeded at a different step. As shown in table I, the student unsuccessfully attempted a\n",
    "step at location “var-0val-1” (trn # 1 & 2). The student subsequently went to location\n",
    "“var-1val-1”, attempted and succeeded at the new step. While the TH incorrectly blamed\n",
    "“label x-axis” which is the KC associated with the new step at location “var-1val-1”, the\n",
    "LH more rationally blamed “choose variable” which is the KC that should be associated\n",

    "it correctly assigns blame to the KC associated with the error. TH however, wrongfully\n",
    "blames the first subsequent KC that the student correctly attempts. Of the 16,291transactions in our dataset, error transactions recorded were 5,733. Of the latter, the LH\n",
    "and TH differed on 1,583 (36%) transactions with respect to error attribution choices.\n",
    "We also found that both the LH and the TH had the tendency to yield the same result\n",
    "when the student succeeded at a step, even after multiple attempts, prior to attempting\n",
    "and succeeding at a new step. This was the case 64% of the time.\n",
    "In table III, average practice opportunity, initial KC difficulties and learning rates are\n",
    "given for KCs and used to describe learning behavior for each heuristic. For example, for\n",
    "the KC “CHOOSE-VAR-TYPE-CAT”, the learning rate (! j ) for the LH was more than 3\n",
    "times that of the TH. Judging by KC initial difficulty (\" j ), “CHOOSE-VAR-TYPE-CAT”\n",
    "appeared more difficult for the model of the TH (-1.449) than for the model of the LH\n",
    "(0.244). The average practice opportunity measured for that skill (6.6), was the same for\n",
    "each heuristic. The latter means that on the average, each student had approximately 7\n",
    "opportunities to practice the KC “CHOOSE-VAR-TYPE-CAT”.\n",
    "From table III, for the most part, KC learning rate was higher for the skills in the\n",
    "cognitive model of the LH compared to that for the TH. The trend for initial KC\n",
    "difficulty was in the opposite direction as seen for KCs such as “MMS-VALUING-\n",

    "Generally, KCs in the cognitive model for TH appeared more difficult to students\n",

    "From table II, the mean learning rate for the LH was 0.133(+0.11) which evaluated\n",

    "TH were 0.08(+1.1) and -1.84(+0.94) respectively. The reason for the latter seems to be\n",
    "due to more errors being attributed to later opportunities in the TH than the LH. These\n",
    "results thus illustrate the effects of error attribution.\n",
    "7. CONCLUSION\n",
    "In this paper, we investigated the generality of performance of two alternative methods\n",
    "for making error attribution in intelligent tutoring systems - the simple location heuristic\n",
    "and the simple temporal heuristic. Our study was carried out in the mathematics domain\n",
    "using data from a cognitive tutor unit on scatterplot generation and interpretation. In\n",
    "support of previous results obtained in the physics domain, we found that the simple\n",
    "location heuristic was better at predicting students’ changes in error rate over time\n",
    "compared to the simple temporal heuristic. This work shows that simpler, easier-to-\n",
    "implement methods can be effective in the process of making error attribution.\n",
    "One observation is that for tutors where the KCs can be determined by the interface\n",
    "location (or widget) in which an action appears it is likely that the LH will show better\n",
    "results than the TH. This feature is mostly true of the scatterplot tutor. It is possible that\n",
    "the TH is better in situations where the different problem subgoals can be associated with\n",
    "a single location. However, our prior results with a physics data set indicated that even in\n",
    "such situations the LH may be better. Further research should explore this issue.\n",
    "We also intend to investigate whether the use of the simple location-based heuristic\n",
    "may improve on-line student modeling and associated future task selection. The\n",
    "availability of datasets from the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center’s ‘DataShop’ (see\n",
    "http://learnlab.org) will facilitate the process of getting appropriate data.\"\"\" |> NormalizeText\n"
